I met George Bussey in March of 2023, about one year before he passed away after a protracted illness. He was in his 80's. George led an extraordinary life. During the year of our acquaintance, I visited George every Friday I could and in the process, learned about his adventures. He grew up in New York City and seemed to know all sorts of famous people. He hung out Andy Warhol's study, for example. He was a dancer. He was attained some sort of exalted position in the Catholic Church in his youth. He taught for a while and later joined the foreign service as a teacher, primarily I think as a teacher of English. He traveled, lived, and worked in Egypt, Yemen, Japan, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Romania. Throughout his travels he made fast friends with many people, absorbed the lanuage and culture, and explored the spirituality of the people and places.
