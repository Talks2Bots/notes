Yes, William Russo, the musician, composed a multimedia piece titled "The Civil War," which is a significant work in his repertoire. This piece is a jazz and classical hybrid that combines elements of music, theater, and spoken word to explore the American Civil War. It's notable for its innovative blend of genres and its poignant exploration of a critical period in American history.

"The Civil War" by Russo is a good example of his approach to composition, which often involved blending different musical styles and incorporating various artistic elements. His background in jazz and classical music, along with his collaborations with diverse artists, allowed him to create works that were both unique and reflective of a broad range of influences.

Russo's work on "The Civil War" is reflective of his broader impact on music, where he often pushed the boundaries of traditional jazz orchestration and composition, influencing the development of jazz and modern orchestral music.

Note that George told me he performed as a dancer in one of Bill Russo's productions in Chicago. As part of the performance, he was called upon to dance extemporaneously with music from a live band for over an hour. Nothing was prescripted. When he asked Russo exactly what the director expected him to do, Russo said: "Listen, you're either a dancer, or you're not."
